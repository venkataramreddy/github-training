<p>This document provides a quick listing of the tools needed and basic install instructions for each -- which is used throughout this course. Before you get started installing all the tools and software for this course, there are a few basic requirements. After that, I provide the general instructions for each tool used. Since this page is designed to aide the "get to the point" crowd, I keep my instructions as brief as possible.</p>



<p>In order to support the most recent version of Windows available, these instructions were tested using <strong>Windows 10</strong>. However, with some modification, these instructions will generally work for older versions of Windows.</p>





<h4>Getting Started and Common Tools</h4>



<p><strong>Admin Rights</strong></p>



<p>You need to have Administrator rights to your system. Most modern versions of Windows come with several "flavors" of user accounts -- only Administrators can install software.</p>





<p><strong>The Right Bits</strong></p>



<p>Windows comes in two flavors: 32-bit and 64-bit. What's even more confusing -- you might have a 32-bit version on hardware able to run 64-bit software.</p>





<p>The fastest way to find out if you have 32 or 64-bits installed:</p>





<ul>
<li>Right-click on the <em>Start Menu</em>, this will display a pop-up menu</li><li>Click on the <em>System</em> item</li><li>Once the <em>System</em> window appears, look for the <strong>System Type</strong> entry under the <em>System</em> section. This should tell you if you have 32 or 64-bit version of Windows.</li></ul>





<p>Make a note of this -- you'll want to install the 32-bit or 64-bit version of any software in order to best match your operating system and to have the best performance possible, when given the choice.</p>





<h4>Google Chrome</h4>



<p><strong>Optional.</strong></p>





<p>I use Google Chrome for most of my courses. A few years ago, I would have strongly recommended or border-lined required the use of Chrome. However, most modern versions of all common browsers are adequate -- although the software engineer in me still prefers Chrome. For those wanting to follow along as closely as possible, install and use Chrome during this course. However, this is an <em>optional</em> step now, but I include it for completeness.</p>





<p><strong>Install for Windows</strong></p>





<ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="[https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title='Google Chrome Desktop"'>Google Chrome Desktop</a> page at <a href="[https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title='Google Chrome Desktop"'>https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop</a></li><li>Click on the <strong>Download Chrome</strong> button</li><li>Accept the <em>Terms of Service</em> agreement (after reading, of course)</li><li>Follow the instructions through the install process</li></ul>





<h4>Git for Windows</h4>



<p><strong>Required.</strong></p>





<p>Git is the source control tool used in this course. While Jenkins supports many other control control tools, Git is the most popular these days.</p>





<p><strong>Install on Windows 10</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="[https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title='Git for Windows Download"'>Download Git for Windows</a> directly from <a href="[https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title='Git for Windows Download"'>https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest</a>.</li><li>Run the installer program, follow the defaults (recommend other choices in the video, but defaults are ok too)</li><li>Open the <strong>Git Bash</strong> program, which is a Bash Shell terminal designed specifically for Git on Windows</li></ul>





<p><strong>Configure Git</strong></p>



<p>Git requires your name and email address before any real work can be done. It is best to just configure Git from the start.</p>





<pre>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@your-place.com"<br></pre>







<h4>Notepad++</h4>



<p><strong>Optional.</strong></p>





<p>Windows comes with a text editor called <strong>Notepad</strong>, but it doesn't do much beyond allow you to edit text and many IT professionals prefer something more. I use a free and open-source program called <strong>Notepad++</strong> for most of my Windows based courses. If you are happy with Notepad, then this step is <em>optional</em>.</p>





<p><strong>Install</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="[https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title='Notepad++ Download Page"'>Download Notepad++</a> from <a href="[https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title='Notepad++ Download Page"'>https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download</a></li><li>Since there are many adverts on the page, ensure you select the <strong>Notepad++ Installer</strong> and not an AD by mistake.</li><li>Once the installer has finished downloading, run the installer.</li><li>Follow all the defaults through the install process with the following exceptions:<ul>
<li>Check <em>Create Shortcut on Desktop</em> (personal choice)</li></ul>
</li></ul>





<p><strong>Notepad++ System-Wide</strong></p>



<p>If you plan to use Notepad++ a lot, I highly recommend adding Notepad++ to your system's PATH environment variable. You can confirm weather or not this is needed by opening a <strong>command prompt</strong> or <strong>Git Bash</strong> and type <code>notepad++</code> and press the <code>enter</code> key. If Notepad++ launches, then no additional work is needed. If you get a <code>Command Not Found</code> or similar error, then add the Notepad++ install folder to the system <strong>Path</strong> variable.</p>





<p><strong>Bash Configuration</strong></p>



<p>Open or create the <strong>~/.bash_profile</strong> file and add the following line:</p>





<pre>alias npp='notepad++ -multiInst -nosession'<br></pre>







<p><strong>Git Integration</strong></p>



<p>Open Git Bash and issue the command:</p>





<pre>git config core.editor "notepad++ -multiInst -nosession"<br></pre>







<p>Then test it out by:</p>





<pre>git config --global -e<br></pre>







<h4>P4Merge on Windows</h4>



<p><em>P4Merge for Windows</em> which is a visual comparsion and merge resolution tool that integrates well with Git.</p>





<p><strong>Install</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="[https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix#clients](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix#clients" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title='Perforce Client Download Page"'>Download P4Merge: Visual Merge Client</a> from <a href="[https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix#clients](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix#clients" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title='Perforce Client Download Page"'>https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix#clients</a></li><li>Once the installer has finished downloading, run the installer.</li><li>Follow all the defaults through the install process with the following exceptions:<ul>
<li>During install, take care to only install the <strong>P4Merge Visual Merge</strong> client</li></ul>
</li></ul>





<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>



<p>Now, let's integrate P4Merge with Git. You'll need to know where P4Merge is installed on your system -- which is normally under <em>Program Files</em>. With the next series of commands, you may need to modify them slightly to fit your system.</p>





<p>Configure P4Merge as <strong>Diff Tool</strong> in Git:</p>





<pre>git config --global diff.tool p4merge
git config --global difftool.p4merge.path "C:/Program Files/Perforce/p4merge.exe"
git config --global difftool.prompt false<br></pre>







<p>Configure P4Merge as <strong>Merge Tool</strong> in Git:</p>





<pre>git config --global merge.tool p4merge
git config --global mergetool.p4merge.path "C:/Program Files/Perforce/p4merge.exe"
git config --global mergetool.prompt false<br></pre>







<p>The above commands should work, but some systems may require converting the paths to Unix friendly versions where C: is replaced with /c/.</p></p>
